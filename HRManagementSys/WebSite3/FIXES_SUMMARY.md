# Employee Dashboard User Controls - Fixes Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. EmployeeAttendance.ascx

- **Fix**: Added the missing event handler to handle Cancel button clicks

### 5. All User Control Code-Behind Files
- **Issue**: Missing `using System.Web.UI;` statements
- **Fix**: Added the missing using statement to all user control code-behind files

### 6. EmployeeDashboard.aspx.cs
- **Issue**: Missing implementation for loading dashboard data

1. Ensure the database is properly set up using the updated `HRManagementDB_Setup.sql`
2. Test the EmployeeDashboard.aspx page with all user controls
3. Verify that all functionality works as expected
4. Remove the test files once everything is confirmed working
